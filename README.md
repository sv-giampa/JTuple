# JTuple: the concept of Tuple in Java
JTuple is a very simple library that defines the concept
of tuple in Java.

A Tuple is an immutable object that aggregates other objects.
It exposes a set of common operations, such as concatenation,
aggregation of objects, head or tail removal, iteration,
and so on.

JTuple defines Bound Tuples: these are tuples whose elements
are assigned to attribute names and types. A bound tuple allows
dynamic type checking of its elements.

For more information about Tuple and BoundTuple classes,
see the Javadoc.
